# Node Challenge #2

Write a Node script called sw.js that accepts a single command line argument <endpoint>.

The script should call the Star Wars API with axios at the endpoint specified by the command line argument and console.log the value of count from the response object.

If the string is not a valid endpoint option, the script should console.log an error.
