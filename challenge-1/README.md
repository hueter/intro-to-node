# Node Challenge #1

Write a Node script called duplicate.js that reads in a single text file (with any contents you want). In a loop, write the contents of the original file into five new files called `copy1.txt`, `copy2.txt`, …etc.

The script should console.log when each file starts and stops writing, e.g. “Writing copy1 now…” , “copy1 finished”.

**BONUS → Do this for images instead of text files.**
